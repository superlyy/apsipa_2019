# GTZAN_split

GTZAN split that I've used for my experiments in the papers [Multi-Level and Multi-Scale Feature Aggregation Using Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks for Music Auto-tagging, IEEE SPL(to be published), 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01793).

__Note that this is fault-filtered list, which is curated list to avoid artist repetition across training, validation, and testing sets in the paper [Deep Learning and Music Adversaries, Kereliuk et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.04761)__
